            Akara, also known as Bean Cakes, Bean Balls, Bean Fritas or Acarajé
            in Portuguese is a Nigerian breakfast recipe made with beans. How to
            Make Akara [Video] To make Akara, you need to first of all remove
            the beans coat. You should remove the coat from the beans just
            before you make the Akara. This means that you can't use coatless
            beans that has been stored in the fridge or freezer to make Akara. I
            tried that and the Akara did not turn out well like the ones made
            with freshly peeled beans.
